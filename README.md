# 🚦 Smart Traffic Light Simulation System

A responsive web-based Traffic Light Simulation System developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that mimics real-world traffic signal behavior with vehicle movement control.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates an automated traffic signal system with realistic timing and vehicle animation.
The system controls the movement of a car based on the traffic signal state and displays a live countdown timer for each signal.

The application also includes a Day/Night mode for enhanced user interface and is fully responsive across all devices.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To simulate a real-time traffic light control system.
* To demonstrate signal state transition logic.
* To control vehicle movement using signal conditions.
* To implement timer-based event handling.
* To create a responsive web-based simulation model.

## ⚙️ How It Works

* The system cycles through **Red → Yellow → Green** signals.
* Each signal stays active for a predefined time interval:

  * 🔴 Red : 5 seconds
  * 🟡 Yellow : 2 seconds
  * 🟢 Green : 5 seconds
* A live countdown timer is displayed.
* The car moves only when the **Green signal** is active.
* The car stops automatically when the signal changes to **Red** or **Yellow**.
* Users can start or stop the simulation.
* Day/Night mode can be toggled for UI theme change.
